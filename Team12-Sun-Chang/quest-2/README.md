# Folder Explanation
1. In the code folder, there are 2 sub-folders. 1) node_serial folder, which represent graphing data read from serial port. 2) tactile folder, which is used to read sensor value using adc and esp32 and this program is flashed onto esp32 so that values can be read using uart.

2. In the "images" folder, we store the images of the graph and our demo.

3. "report.md" is also included in this folder and explains our project summary, quest 2 evaluation, solution designs, investigative question, sketches, supporting artifacts, sources and references.
