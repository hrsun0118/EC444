## Summary
I wrote a program to get input through UART and then perform 3 tasks and switch between these 3 tasks. These 3 tasks are: 1) toggle the LED light ON & OFF. 2) echo the input to the Console monitor. 3) convert the input integers to hexadecimal numbers and output it on the Console Monitor.
