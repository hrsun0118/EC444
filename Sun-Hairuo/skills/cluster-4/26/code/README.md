# Code Explanation
In the db.js file, I store data from smoke.txt into mongodb's database and obtain the data from this database. To achieve this goal, I went through 3 steps:
1. First, install mongodb and start its service in terminal.
2. Use "readStream" to get the smoke data from smoke.txt file. Parse the data into a 2D array. (data parsing is not required.)
3. Instantiate a MongoClient and a specific URL. Store the data using "insertMany()".
4. Retrieve the data from Mongodb database using "find()" method with MonogoCLient.
