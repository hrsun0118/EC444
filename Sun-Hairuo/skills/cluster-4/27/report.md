## Summary
In this skill, I implemented a finite state machine for the whack-a-mole game. In this game, the user can start the game, hit the mole in the game to get 10 points for the score and exit the game when time out. Timer and alarm are used for implementing time_out for the game and time_out for "hitting the mole".
