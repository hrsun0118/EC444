## Summary
In this task, I modified the esp wifi station example code from esp-idf to connect esp32 to my home WiFi. After flashing esp32, conosle output shown that I have succesfully connected to my home wifi. Then, I went on to my Xfinity router admin page and found that esp32 device with name "espressif" is shown on the "connected device" list.
